                    draft-howe-vcon-lawful-basis-00

Abstract

   This document defines a lawful basis extension for Virtualized
   Conversations (vCon) that provides standardized mechanisms for
   recording, verifying, and managing the lawful basis for processing
   data within conversation containers.  The lawful basis extension
   addresses privacy compliance challenges through structured attachment
   metadata, including the specific lawful basis being asserted,
   temporal validity periods where applicable, and cryptographic proof
   mechanisms.

   The extension is designed as a Compatible vCon extension that
   introduces lawful basis management capabilities without altering
   existing vCon semantics.  It defines a "lawful_basis" attachment type
   with structured records for each of the six lawful bases defined in
   regulations like GDPR, including consent, contract, legal obligation,
   vital interests, public task, and legitimate interests.

   Key features include automated lawful basis detection during
   conversation processing, auditable records with cryptographic proofs,
   granular purpose-based permissions for all lawful bases, documented
   justifications for other lawful bases, and integration with privacy
   regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.

1.  Introduction

   Conversations originating from all modes (voice, video, email, fax
   and messaging), contain sensitive information that requires a
   documented lawful basis for processing to comply with privacy
   regulations and ethical standards.  This document defines a lawful
   basis extension for Virtualized Conversations (vCon) that enables
   automated lawful basis detection, structured recording, and
   cryptographic proof mechanisms.

   A vCon (Virtualized Conversation) is a standardized container format
   for storing conversation data, including metadata, participants, and
   conversation content, as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-vcon-core-00].
   The vCon specification supports extensible attachments that can carry
   additional structured data related to the conversation.

   This lawful basis extension provides a Compatible vCon extension (as
   defined in Section 2.5 of [I-D.draft-ietf-vcon-core-00]) that
   introduces lawful basis management capabilities through a
   standardized "lawful_basis" attachment type.  The extension captures
   essential metadata including:

   *  The specific lawful basis being asserted for processing

   *  Party identification (for consent-based processing)

   *  Temporal validity periods (where applicable)

   *  Granular purpose-based permissions

   *  Documented justifications for non-consent-based lawful bases

   *  Cryptographic proof mechanisms and external verification

   *  Integration with SCITT transparency services for audit trails

   The lawful basis extension addresses key privacy and compliance
   challenges while maintaining compatibility with existing vCon
   implementations.  Implementations that do not recognize the lawful
   basis extension can safely ignore lawful basis attachments while
   maintaining valid processing of other vCon content.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Core Terms

   *Lawful Basis*: A valid justification, as defined by applicable law
   (e.g., GDPR), for the processing of personal data.  One of six
   potential bases must be identified prior to processing.

   *Data Subject*: The identified or identifiable natural person to whom
   personal data relates [GDPR].

   *Lawful Basis Attachment*: A vCon attachment with type "lawful_basis"
   that contains structured information documenting the lawful basis for
   processing conversation data.

   *Attestation Registry*: An external transparency service that
   maintains an authoritative, verifiable log of attestations about a
   vCon, which can include attestations of a lawful basis.  This
   document defines integration with registries using the SCITT
   protocol.

   *Compatible Extension*: A vCon extension that introduces additional
   data without altering the meaning or structure of existing elements,
   as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-vcon-core-00].

3.  Overview of Lawful Bases

   While this document defines an extension for recording any lawful
   basis for processing, it is important to understand the distinctions
   between them.  Under regulations like the GDPR, there are six lawful
   bases for processing personal data.  Consent is unique in that it is
   a permission granted by the data subject, while the other five are
   justifications asserted by the data controller.  Understanding this
   distinction is critical for correctly implementing this extension.

   The six lawful bases for processing under GDPR are:

   1.  *Consent*: The data subject has given clear, unambiguous consent
       for their personal data to be processed for a specific purpose.
       This basis is unique because it originates with the data subject.

   2.  *Contract*: The processing is necessary for a contract that the
       data subject has with the organization, or because they have
       asked the organization to take specific steps before entering
       into a contract.  For example, processing a customer's address to
       deliver a purchased product.

   3.  *Legal Obligation*: The processing is necessary for the
       organization to comply with the law (not including contractual
       obligations).  For example, a financial institution may be
       legally required to report certain transactions to prevent fraud.

   4.  *Vital Interests*: The processing is necessary to protect
       someone's life.  For example, sharing a patient's medical history
       with emergency services.

   5.  *Public Task*: The processing is necessary for the organization
       to perform a task in the public interest or for its official
       functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.
       For example, a local authority processing data to provide public
       services.

   6.  *Legitimate Interests*: The processing is necessary for the
       organization's legitimate interests or the legitimate interests
       of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the
       individual's personal data which overrides those legitimate
       interests.  For example, a business using customer data for
       marketing analysis to improve its services, provided it does not
       infringe on the customer's privacy rights.

   This lawful basis extension for vCon provides a standardized way to
   record and verify any of these lawful bases.  The presence and
   content of a lawful_basis attachment are intended to be the primary
   mechanism for determining the authorized uses of a vCon's data.

4.  vCon Lawful Basis Extension Definition

4.1.  Extension Classification

   The lawful basis extension is a *Compatible Extension* as defined in
   Section 2.5 of [I-D.draft-ietf-vcon-core-00].  This extension:

   *  Introduces additional lawful basis metadata without altering
      existing vCon semantics

   *  Can be safely ignored by implementations that don't support lawful
      basis processing

   *  Does not require listing in the must_support parameter

   *  Maintains backward compatibility with existing vCon
      implementations

4.2.  Extension Registration

   This document defines the "lawful_basis" extension token for
   registration in the vCon Extensions Names Registry:

   }, "registry": { "type": "scitt", "url":
   "https://transparency.example.com/lawful_purpose/registry" } } }

6.  Lawful Basis Processing Requirements

6.1.  Content Hash Validation

   Implementations MUST validate content hashes when present in lawful
   basis attachments:

   1.  *Canonicalization*: Apply the specified canonicalization method
       to the lawful basis attachment body

       *  For "jcs" canonicalization: Use JSON Canonicalization Scheme
          per RFC 8785

       *  Sort object keys lexicographically

       *  Remove insignificant whitespace

       *  Ensure consistent number representations

   2.  *Hash Computation*: Compute the hash using the specified
       algorithm

       *  For "sha-256": Use SHA-256 algorithm

       *  For "sha-3-256": Use SHA-3-256 algorithm

       *  For "blake2b-256": Use BLAKE2b-256 algorithm

   3.  *Hash Verification*: Compare computed hash with the provided
       value

       *  Reject processing if hashes do not match

       *  Log hash validation results for audit purposes

   4.  *Error Handling*: Provide specific error reporting for hash
       validation failures

       *  *ContentHashMismatchError*: Computed hash does not match
          provided value

       *  *UnsupportedHashAlgorithmError*: Hash algorithm not supported
          by implementation

       *  *UnsupportedCanonicalizationError*: Canonicalization method
          not supported by implementation

6.2.  Temporal Validity

   Implementations MUST validate lawful basis expiration before
   processing:

   1.  Compare current time against expiration timestamp

   2.  Account for reasonable clock skew (maximum 5 minutes recommended)

   3.  Reject processing if lawful basis has expired

   4.  Support null expiration for indefinite validity subject to
       revalidation intervals

6.3.  Reference Validation

   Implementations MUST validate attachment references:

   1.  Verify party index exists in vCon parties array

   2.  Verify dialog indices exist in vCon dialog array

6.4.  Granular Permission Evaluation

   When processing vCon content, implementations MUST:

   1.  Check for applicable lawful basis attachments for the requested
       processing purpose

   2.  Evaluate all relevant purpose grants for the specific purpose

   3.  Apply most restrictive permission when multiple grants apply

   4.  Deny processing if no valid permission exists or if it is
       explicitly denied

6.5.  Proof Verification

   Implementations SHOULD verify proof mechanisms when present:

   1.  Validate cryptographic signatures using appropriate algorithms

   2.  Verify external document integrity using content hashes

   3.  Check external system lawful basis status via API calls

   4.  Log proof verification results for audit purposes

7.  Transparency Service Integration

7.1.  Registry Services

   The optional registry field enables integration with external
   attestation registries for audit trails.  The registry object's type
   field specifies the protocol to be used.

   When the registry object is present and its type is "scitt", the url
   field MUST:

   *  Reference a SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and
      Trust) Transparency Service implementing SCRAPI
      [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi-05]

   *  Provide cryptographic receipts for state changes

   *  Support status queries and updates

   *  Implement appropriate access controls and privacy protections

   Other transparency service types may be used if they are registered
   with IANA.  The documentation for each registered type must specify
   the necessary protocols and interaction models.

7.2.  Registry Integration Requirements

   Implementations that support registries MUST:

   1.  Use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher for all communications

   2.  Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms

   3.  Validate SCITT receipts using standard verification procedures

   4.  Handle service unavailability gracefully

   5.  Cache lawful basis state within configured intervals

7.3.  Privacy Considerations for Registries

   Registry services SHOULD:

   *  Store only lawful basis metadata, not full conversation content

   *  Implement privacy-preserving query mechanisms

   *  Maintain audit logs for regulatory compliance

   *  Support deletion and other personal data compliance
      responsibilities

8.  Error Handling

   Implementations SHOULD provide specific error reporting:

   *  *LawfulBasisExpiredError*: Lawful basis has expired and cannot be
      used

   *  *PermissionDeniedError*: Permission explicitly denies the
      requested processing

   *  *LawfulBasisMissingError*: No valid lawful basis found for the
      requested processing

   *  *ProofVerificationError*: Lawful basis proof mechanisms failed
      validation

   *  *ReferenceValidationError*: Attachment references invalid vCon
      elements

   *  *ContentHashMismatchError*: Computed hash does not match provided
      value

   *  *UnsupportedHashAlgorithmError*: Hash algorithm not supported by
      implementation

   *  *UnsupportedCanonicalizationError*: Canonicalization method not
      supported by implementation

9.  Interoperability

   To ensure interoperability across implementations:

   *  Use only standard JSON data types in lawful basis body structures

   *  Support graceful degradation when advanced features are
      unavailable

   *  Implement lawful basis attachment format negotiation for multi-
      party exchanges

10.  Security Considerations

   The vcon-core specification provides general-purpose security
   mechanisms, such as digital signatures, designed to ensure the basic
   integrity of the vCon container.  These mechanisms answer the
   question, "Has this vCon been tampered with?"  However, managing
   lawful basis requires addressing a more specific and legally
   significant question: "Did this specific person provide a valid basis
   for this specific action at a specific time?"  Answering this
   question requires a higher level of security and contextual
   awareness.  The following sections detail the additional security
   considerations that are critical for a lawful basis mechanism to be
   considered trustworthy and compliant with privacy regulations.

10.1.  Cryptographic Protection and Forgery

   *Background:* Forgery is the act of creating a fake record or
   altering an existing one—for instance, by changing the expiration
   date, expanding the scope of what was agreed to, or faking the
   identity of the party.  The ability to prove that a lawful basis is
   authentic and unaltered is the bedrock of any privacy compliance
   framework like GDPR or CCPA.  A forged record is equivalent to having
   no lawful basis at all and carries severe legal and financial
   penalties.  While vcon-core provides a signature field, this
   extension adds the necessary business rules to ensure that a
   signature represents a trusted, verifiable, and legally binding act.

   *Requirements:* Implementations MUST prevent forgery through:

   *  Cryptographic signature verification for digital proof mechanisms.

   *  External document integrity validation using content hashes.

   *  Secure communication channels for external verification.

   *  Audit logging of all validation activities.

10.2.  Replay Attack Prevention

   *Background:* A replay attack involves an attacker copying a valid
   lawful basis attachment from one vCon and maliciously inserting it
   into a different vCon that the user never actually provided a basis
   for.  Without replay protection, a user's lawful basis for a non-
   sensitive inquiry could be "replayed" to appear as if they provided
   it for the recording and analysis of a highly sensitive conversation.
   This would be a massive privacy violation and would render the
   mechanism meaningless.

   *Requirements:* The lawful basis attachment design MUST prevent
   replay attacks through:

   *  Cryptographic binding to specific vCon instances.

   *  Timestamp validation with appropriate clock skew tolerance.

   *  Nonce inclusion in proof mechanisms where applicable.

   *  Reference validation to ensure lawful basis applies to correct
      content.

10.3.  Secure Communication Channels

   *Background:* Lawful basis records are themselves sensitive personal
   data.  It is critical that they are protected while in transit
   between systems.  An attacker in a "man-in-the-middle" position could
   intercept a vCon and alter it before it reaches its destination,
   potentially stripping or modifying lawful basis information.

   *Requirements:* All lawful basis attachments MUST be integrity
   protected using vCon signing mechanisms as defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-vcon-core-00].  Lawful basis attachments containing
   sensitive information SHOULD be encrypted when transmitted outside
   secure environments, for instance by using TLS 1.2 or higher for all
   communications.

10.4.  Audit Logging

   *Background:* Lawful basis is a matter of legal and regulatory
   compliance.  If a dispute arises, the organization processing the
   data must be able to _prove_ it had a valid lawful basis at the time
   of the action.  An audit log provides this crucial, non-repudiable
   evidence for regulators, auditors, and courts.  It is a cornerstone
   of the "accountability" principle in modern privacy law.

   *Requirements:* Systems that process or manage lawful basis
   attachments SHOULD maintain a secure, immutable record of all related
   activities (e.g., when a lawful basis was given, checked, revoked, or
   expired).  When a registry is used, this requirement may be fulfilled
   by the registry service.

11.  Privacy and Regulatory Compliance

11.1.  Data Minimization

   Lawful basis attachments MUST implement data minimization principles
   by:

   *  Including only information necessary for verification

   *  Avoiding duplication of personal data already in vCon elements

   *  Supporting attachment redaction while maintaining verifiability

   *  Implementing privacy-preserving verification mechanisms

11.2.  Regulatory Alignment

   The lawful basis extension addresses requirements from major privacy
   regulations:

   *  *GDPR Article 7*: Conditions for lawful basis including withdrawal
      mechanisms

   *  *CCPA Section 1798.135*: Requirements for personal information
      processing

   *  *HIPAA Privacy Rule*: Requirements for protected health
      information

   Implementers MUST ensure their implementations comply with applicable
   regulations in their jurisdiction.

11.3.  Data Subject Rights

   Implementations MUST support data subject rights including:

   *  *Right of Access*: Enable data subjects to access their records

   *  *Right of Rectification*: Allow correction of inaccurate
      information

   *  *Right to be Forgotten*: Support deletion and data erasure

   *  *Right of Portability*: Enable export of data in interoperable
      formats

   *  *Withdrawal*: Provide mechanisms for revocation of a lawful basis

12.  Conclusion

   This document defines a comprehensive lawful basis extension for vCon
   that balances privacy protection with practical implementation
   requirements.  The extension provides a foundation for lawful basis-
   aware conversation processing while maintaining compatibility with
   existing vCon infrastructure.

13.  Security and Privacy Considerations Summary

   This lawful basis extension addresses several critical security and
   privacy concerns:

   *Integrity*: Cryptographic protection prevents unauthorized
   modification of records while maintaining verifiability across system
   boundaries.

   *Temporal Security*: Expiration controls and revalidation intervals
   ensure a lawful basis cannot be misused beyond its intended temporal
   scope.

   *Audit Transparency*: SCITT integration provides cryptographic audit
   trails for operations while maintaining privacy protections.

   *Regulatory Compliance*: Structured management supports compliance
   with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy regulations through
   standardized metadata and processing controls.

   *Data Minimization*: Privacy-preserving design minimizes data
   collection and supports lawful basis-driven access controls
   throughout the conversation lifecycle.

   Implementers should conduct thorough security reviews and ensure
   compliance with applicable privacy regulations in their deployment
   environments.
